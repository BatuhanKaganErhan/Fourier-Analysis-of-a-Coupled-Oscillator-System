# Fourier-Analysis-of-a-Single-Oscillator-System
This repository contains a numerical study of the Fourier transform of a three-coupled-oscillator system. The script extracts the frequency components of each oscillator's motion and generates frequency-intensity plots, revealing the dominant vibrational modes and their spectral characteristics.
